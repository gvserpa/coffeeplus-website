## Project Description

This project is a **CoffeePLUS landing page**, created with a focus on **design and CSS organization**. The main goal was to **practice layout, animations, and component structure** without implementing backend functionality or real button interactions.  

The site features:

- Well-structured sections with titles, images, and cards.  
- Buttons with hover animations to practice CSS effects.  
- Highlighted cards and elements to reinforce visual hierarchy.  
- Experiments with responsiveness for different screen sizes.

> ⚠️ Note: The buttons and forms are **visual only** and do not have active functionality.
